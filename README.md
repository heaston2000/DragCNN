# DragCNN

MATLAB convolutional neural network for computing drag, based off of the work done by Jonathan Viquerat and Elie Hachem - 2020


Research done with Michaela Kubacki, Assisstant Professor of Mathematics - Middlebury College, Summer 2021

Includes subfolder with files used for MATLAB custom training loop (these do not work). Instead use data set, dragPreprocess.m, dragMaster.m and dragGraph.m files for the training of an accurate network.
